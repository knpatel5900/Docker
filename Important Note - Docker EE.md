## Docker Enterprise has now been acquired by Mirantis. There are two primary impact of this:

# 1. All the Docker EE related documentation from the official website are re-directed to Mirantis docs. This has broken a lot of things and many details are not available as expected.

# 2. Docker EE trial is no longer available from the Docker page and instead, a different approach is used based on Mirantis suggested way.

# In the longer term, we expect that Docker EE will no longer be part of the official exam since it is no longer an official product, but for the time being, I will encourage you to go through the section theoretically as you can expect questions from this section till the time new exam is available.
