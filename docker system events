delete
import
load
pull
push
save
tag
untag
Plugins
Docker plugins report the following events:

install
enable
disable
remove
Volumes
Docker volumes report the following events:

create
mount
unmount
destroy
Networks
Docker networks report the following events:

create
connect
disconnect
destroy
Daemons
Docker daemons report the following events:

reload
Limiting, filtering, and formatting the output
Limit events by time
The --since and --until parameters can be Unix timestamps, date formatted timestamps, or Go duration strings (e.g. 10m, 1h30m) computed relative to the client machine’s time. If you do not provide the --since option, the command returns only new and/or live events. Supported formats for date formatted time stamps include RFC3339Nano, RFC3339, 2006-01-02T15:04:05, 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999, 2006-01-02Z07:00, and 2006-01-02. The local timezone on the client will be used if you do not provide either a Z or a +-00:00 timezone offset at the end of the timestamp. When providing Unix timestamps enter seconds[.nanoseconds], where seconds is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds (aka Unix epoch or Unix time), and the optional .nanoseconds field is a fraction of a second no more than nine digits long.

Filtering (--filter)
The filtering flag (-f or --filter) format is of “key=value”. If you would like to use multiple filters, pass multiple flags (e.g., --filter "foo=bar" --filter "bif=baz")

Using the same filter multiple times will be handled as a OR; for example --filter container=588a23dac085 --filter container=a8f7720b8c22 will display events for container 588a23dac085 OR container a8f7720b8c22

Using multiple filters will be handled as a AND; for example --filter container=588a23dac085 --filter event=start will display events for container container 588a23dac085 AND the event type is start

The currently supported filters are:

container (container=<name or id>)
daemon (daemon=<name or id>)
event (event=<event action>)
image (image=<tag or id>)
label (label=<key> or label=<key>=<value>)
network (network=<name or id>)
plugin (plugin=<name or id>)
type (type=<container or image or volume or network or daemon or plugin>)
volume (volume=<name or id>)
For example uses of this command, refer to the examples section below.

Options
Name, shorthand	Default	Description
--filter , -f		Filter output based on conditions provided
--format		Format the output using the given Go template
--since		Show all events created since timestamp
--until		Stream events until this timestamp
