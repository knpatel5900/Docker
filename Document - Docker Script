Note: 

Please make sure that you make use of the same OS that we have used during videos (CentOS 7). If you are making use of some different OS, then the steps would be a little different.

# Step 1: Open a text file named docker-install.sh via the vi editor

vi docker-install.sh

# Step 2: Paste the following script within the text file and save it

#!/bin/bash
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum -y install docker-ce
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# Step 3: Make the script executable:

chmod +x docker-install.sh

Step 4: Run the script:

./docker-install.sh
